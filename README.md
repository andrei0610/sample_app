##Twitter Like App
A Twitter clone web app I wrote in Ruby on Rails by following [Michael Hartl's Rails book](http://www.railstutorial.org/book), with a few twists along the way. An excellent intro into:
* Agile principles
* Test Driven Development
* version control with Git
* rapid frontend development with Twitter Bootstrap
